# This R script is a replication of 'vignette/run_microsim.rmd' for those
# who would rather run the analysis in an R script.

# It demonstrates the C++ functions defined in 'src/define_microsim.cpp'.

# The model used as an example is the sick-sicker model published elsewhere;
# Krijkamp et al. 2018. Microsimulation modeling for health decision sciences using R: a tutorial
# https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6349385/.

# We convert the model to C++ and uses the Rcpp package to run as R functions.
# This runs MUCH faster because:
# 1. all individuals run through the model simultaneously (vectorised)
# 2. C++ is faster than R for these operations.

# Of these two things (1) is probably more important!

# Please ensure that you open this project by launching the sickSickerRcpp.Rproj file.
#
# If this is not possible then:
#   
# 1. set the working directory to the project folder (sickSickerRcpp/)
# e.g. setwd("C:/Users/r_a_s/Documents/Projects/DPA_courses/sickSickerRcpp")
# 2. ensure the file 'src/define_microsim.cpp' is in the working directory
# "define_microsim.cpp" %in% list.files("src/") 
# 3. install the "Rcpp" and "RcppArmadillo" packages
#install.packages("Rcpp")
#install.packages("RcppArmadillo")
